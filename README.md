## Conflict Plan
  - For small conflicts, Rock Paper Scissors 

  - Clear, Kind Communication
  
  - Address problems as they arise
  
  - Open input from all members
  
  - Twice daily checkins:

    - one before lunch
    - one at the end of the day

   - If a conflict is addressed twice, then we can discuss escalation.
 
 ## Communication
  - See conflict plan for checkins and communication protocols. 

  - We have agreed as a group that working outside of class hours and on the weekend will only be done as a last resort.
